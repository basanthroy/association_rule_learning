Space Complexity
-----------------
O(l * n) - Assuming l is the number of lines and n is the maximum number of artists in each line

Time Complexity
----------------
O(l * n)

This problem is a well known problem in machine learning known as "Associative Rule Learning". There are 
very efficient algorithms as well as mentioned in the following URLs
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_rule_learning

My algorithm is based on simpler Hashing logic. But it may not perform as well as the other publicly known algorithms.
Please take that into consideration.
